This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Optional: use the compile script in MMAIWASM to build the wasm file (you'll need emscripten):

```bash
cd ../MMAIWASM
sh compile.sh
```

We use rspack to build and run. To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```
